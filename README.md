Oryx(SRS Stack), is an all-in-one, out-of-the-box, and open-source video solution for creating 
online video services, including live streaming and WebRTC, on the cloud or through self-hosting.

> Note: We renamed the project from SRS Stack to Oryx, because we only need a new name for AI assistant to identify 
> SRS and SRS Stack. AI assistant is confused with SRS and SRS Stack.

Oryx makes it easy for you to create an online video service. It is made using Go, Reactjs, SRS, 
FFmpeg, and WebRTC. It supports protocols like RTMP, WebRTC, HLS, HTTP-FLV, and SRT. It offers features 
like authentication, streaming on multiple platforms, recording, transcoding, virtual live events, 
automatic HTTPS, and an easy-to-use HTTP Open API.

> Note: For more details on the Oryx, please visit the following [link](https://www.figma.com/file/Ju5h2DZeJMzUtx5k7D0Oak/Oryx).

## Usage

Run Oryx in one docker, then open http://localhost in browser:

```bash
docker run --restart always -d -it --name oryx -v $HOME/data:/data \
  -p 80:2022 -p 443:2443 -p 1935:1935 -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp \
  ossrs/oryx:5
```

> Important: Remember to mount the `/data` volume to avoid losing data when the container restarts. For instance, 
> if you mount `/data` to `$HOME/data`, all data will be stored in the `$HOME/data` folder. Be sure to modify this 
> according to your desired directory.

> Important: To use WebRTC WHIP in a browser, avoid using localhost or 127.0.0.1. Instead, use a private IP (e.g., https://192.168.3.85), 
> a public IP (e.g., https://136.12.117.13), or a domain (e.g., https://your-domain.com). To set up HTTPS, 
> refer to [this post](https://blog.ossrs.io/how-to-secure-srs-with-lets-encrypt-by-1-click-cb618777639f).

> Note: In China, use `registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/ossrs/oryx:5` to accelerate the Docker pull process 
> and ensure the proper language is set.
