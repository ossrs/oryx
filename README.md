SRS Stack makes it easy for you to create an online video service with just one click, either on cloud 
platforms like DigitalOcean or AWS or by self-hosting. This open-source, simple video solution is made 
using Go, Reactjs, SRS, FFmpeg, and WebRTC. It supports protocols like RTMP, WebRTC, HLS, HTTP-FLV, and 
SRT. It offers features like authentication, streaming on multiple platforms, recording, virtual live 
events, automatic HTTPS, and an easy-to-use HTTP Open API.
